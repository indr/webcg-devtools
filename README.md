# webcg-devtools

webcg-devtools provides tools and a user interface to develop and debug templates (graphic overlays) for CasparCG and WebCG.

Running examples can be found at http://indr.github.io/webcg-framework/ and https://indr.github.io/webcg-adobe-animate-adapter/.  A running demo of the webcg-devtools without any overlays can be found here at https://indr.github.io/webcg-devtools/.

This package comes bundled with [webcg-adobe-animate-adapter](https://github.com/indr/webcg-adobe-animate-adapter), an adapter that lets you use HTML5 Canvas templates created with Adobe Animate with CasparCG and WebCG.
